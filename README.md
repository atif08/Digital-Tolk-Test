### Thoughts about the code

### What is good about the code
 - WHY
   - Good thing about the code is that it is using repository pattern. The benefit of using the repository pattern is that we have more control over the code, and it is more robust to changes. For example if we want to swap out a package with another package we can do so without a lot of refactoring the code. We can also use the repository pattern to avoid code duplication hence following the DRY principal and keep common code in one place and reuse that code where needed. 

### What is bad about the code

### Refactoring

While refactoring I considered following points 
- follow DRY principles
- use proper type hinting
- use proper typed return type for methods
- readable code 
- dedicated methods
- easy to understand naming
- close to english
_NOTE: Refactoring is based on PHP 8.1.5 and Laravel v9.34.0_

1. app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php
    - Namespace name doesn't match the PSR-0/PSR-4 project structure. Fixed to `App`
    - Fixed namespace `DTApi\Models` to `App\Models`
    - Fixed namespace `DTApi\Http` to `App\Http`
    - env() function is used outside of config files. It will always return the default value if config is cached. Created digital_tolk.php config file and moved the values and code there. So changed env() with config() calls in this file. 
    - Added proper type hinted properties and methods return types
    - Fixed use of potentially undefined variables.
    - Removed unused variables and code
    - move some repeated code to a common method getDataAndAuthUser()
    - used inline simple expressions instead of storing them in variables. Will improve memory usage.
    - removed duplicated code within condition
    - fixed Array index is immediately overwritten before accessing
    - fixed env() function is used outside of config files. It always returns the default value if config is cached.
    - Model::is() is a default laravel methods. Expected parameter is Model object but string was given. I guess we want to compare user type here so changed the method name.
    - method addInfo() is not available in the current version of Monologger library. so replaced it with info() method.
    - fixed missing returns and return types of methods.
    - fixed - Optional parameter should be provided after required parameters
    - methods were called using "bookingRepository" property. but that is not defined in the class.
    - array_only() helper function is not available is current version of laravel. replaced with \Arr::only()
    - imported Throttles model class
    - removed extra Unreachable statements
    - extracted common parts in 'if' statement
    - converted switch statement to match (latest in php 8)
    - removed un necessary argument because it matches the parameter's default value
    - simplified the if statements where possible
    - Condition is always 'false' because parent condition is already 'true' at this point. so removed the elseif
    - Condition is unnecessary because it is already checked by isset
    - removed unused variables and some other fixes

2. app/Repository/BookingRepository.php
    - Namespace name doesn't match the PSR-0/PSR-4 project structure. Fixed to `App`
    - fixed namespace issues
    - 

3. app/Repository/BaseRepository.php
**NOTE:** i did not read the readme file attached with the files provided so started refactoring this file. then I realized refactoring of this file is not required. so following is the partial refactor.
   - #### App/Http/Controllers/Controller class refactoring
     - the base Controller.php class is namespaced as `DTApi` and this is against the psr-0 and psr-4 which says that the namespaces should match  to the directory path paths, relative to the package root. So I've refactored it to be under `App` namespace to make it compatible with psr-4 standard.
     - there is a trait `Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\Access\AuthorizesResources` imported in the file which is not available, so I removed it.
 - #### \DTApi\Repository\BaseRepository class refactoring
   - again this class is not following the psr-4 standards, so I moved this class under the `App` namespace to math with its directory path. Other solution I can use is to create a `"DTApi"` folder inside the project's root folder and put this file there, but I opted for changing this file's namespace to be more consistent with Laravel directory structure convention.
   - `DTApi\Exceptions\ValidationException` is being imported in this class but not found in the project, so I removed it. I may have created this file in the `DTApi` folder in the Laravel root folder, but I have no information of the purpose of the file, so I just removed the import.
   - `validatorAttributeNames()` method:  added array as return type
